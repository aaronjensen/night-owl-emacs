# Night Owl for Emacs

Based entirely on Sarah Drasner's amazing [Night Owl VSCode Theme][]. Built by
modifying Kelvin Smith's [monokai-emacs][]. Many thanks to both Sarah Drasner
and Kelvin Smith.

## Status

Very initial development. Still contains some of the monokai colors. PRs gladly accepted.
